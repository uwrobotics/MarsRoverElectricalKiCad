## What is Design Rule Check(DRC)?

DRC is a validation process used to see if a PCB layout follows manufacturer and designer specified design guidelines.

Some key properity DRC will check over:
- Clearance: Physical Spacing between conduction elements(failures include: shorts and signal integrity) [Routing technique](https://www.terratel.eu/routing-methods.html)
- Trace Width: Trace width satisfied the planned current load(failures include: circuit failure and overheating) (common pitfall: insufficient vias; unexpected trace loading)
- Component Placement: Avoid component interference(failure include: heat disspation and signal integrity)
